              Hey! I am Amen Tyagi, a UX Designer with 2.5 years of experience
              in the design industry. In past 2.5 years, I've learnt and gained
              a lot of experience from freelancing to running my design-based
              businesses online and from working full-time jobs to mentoring &
              consulting young startups and even teach UX Design fundamental to
              students across various communities. I am a people's person and I
              love sharing experiences and learning from people. I believe one
              of my favourite quotes describe it very well, "There are no
              strangers in this world, Only friends that I haven't met yet". I
              always maintain good relations with my folks, and that is why I
              can say, My friends, acquaintances and my network are one of
              biggest strengths as a person. Right now I am looking for
              opportunities to move to a completely new place anywhere in the
              world and begin a new adventure, make more friends and grow
              further as a person.. And in case you were wondering, I am more of
              a dog person, my favourite food are Pizza and Gol-Gappe and I am 6
              feet tall. Keep your kindness alive. Cheers. Amen Tyagi.
